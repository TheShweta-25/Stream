        /*
        Abstraction Overhead:
        Streams provide a high-level abstraction and may introduce some overhead due to lambda expressions, method chaining, and internal iteration.
        Traditional for or while loops are usually faster in tight performance-critical code, especially when dealing with primitive types.
        Autoboxing/Unboxing:
        Stream operations may cause autoboxing, especially when using Stream<Integer> instead of IntStream. This adds to memory and CPU cost.
        Parallelism:
        Streams make it easier to achieve parallelism using .parallelStream(), which can lead to significant performance gains for CPU-intensive tasks on large datasets.
        However, parallel streams can also be slower if misused (e.g., small datasets, I/O operations, shared mutable state), due to the cost of thread management and splitting work.
         Lazy Evaluation:
        Stream pipelines are lazily evaluated, meaning operations are only performed when a terminal operation is invoked. This can optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary operations.
        Traditional loops evaluate eagerly â€” they do everything step by step, regardless of whether it's ultimately needed.

       Q.  How would you handle exceptions inside a stream pipeline?
        Streams don't have built-in exception handling, especially for checked exceptions, so you need to handle
